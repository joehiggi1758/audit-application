# Digital Internal Audit AI Chatbot ðŸ¤–

## Overview
Welcome to the **Digital Internal Audit AI Chatbot** repository! This project showcases an interactive question-answering chatbot designed specifically for internal audit professionals. By utilizing a machine learning model, this app helps auditors interactively query documents, making it easier to extract insights from audit reports and manuals, improving productivity, and speeding up audit processes.

This project leverages modern AI technologies, including Hugging Face Transformers, and showcases practical software engineering skills, including Python development, containerization, and deployment on Linux environments.

## Features
- **Interactive QA Chatbot**: Ask questions about a given audit document or passage, and get accurate responses in real time.
- **Powered by DistilBERT**: Uses the DistilBERT model for efficient and extractive question answering.
- **Web Interface**: Developed using Streamlit, allowing easy access and an intuitive chat-like interface.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Designed to run seamlessly on Linux servers, making it easy to integrate into existing audit infrastructure.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for development.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For utilizing pre-trained NLP models.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly web application.
- **Linux**: Configured for server-side deployment, leveraging bash scripting for automation and orchestration.

## Usage
- **Overview Page**: Provides an introduction and explanation of how the app works.
- **Chat with QA Bot Page**: Enter an audit document or passage as context, and interact with the chatbot by asking relevant questions.

## Project Structure
- **app.py**: Main Streamlit application file.
- **Dockerfile**: Contains the instructions to containerize the application.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **README.md**: This file, containing the project documentation.

## Example Use Cases
1. **Internal Audit Analysis**: Upload sections of an audit report and query specific parts, such as controls, findings, or compliance requirements.
2. **Compliance Checks**: Quickly get answers about policy compliance by querying related sections of regulatory documents.
3. **Training and Knowledge Sharing**: Use the chatbot for training junior auditors by providing instant access to critical insights from various documents.

## Deployment
This application is designed for easy deployment in a cloud or on-premises environment using Linux. The containerized nature ensures consistent performance and ease of scalability.
